While you and your team have successfully implemented a speech-to-text feature across desktop and Android devices, encountering issues specifically with iOS can be frustrating. This article will detail the steps to troubleshoot the problem, as well as offer potential solutions to ensure your app performs optimally across all platforms.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Behind Story</strong></em></p>\n<p>Having always been passionate about health and technology, I was excited when the opportunity arose to interview with <a href=\"https://ivybears.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">IvyBears</a>.\r\nI admired their commitment to integrating wellness into daily life through innovative gummy supplements, and I saw a potential fit for my skills as a software developer.</p>\n<p>After a rigorous interview process filled with engaging discussions about the future of health tech and my potential contributions to their team, I eagerly awaited feedback.\r\nHowever, days turned into weeks, and the silence began to weigh on me.\r\nWhile the lack of communication was disheartening, I remained hopeful and dedicated to my craft.\r\nI continued working on personal projects and honing my skills, always with an eye on the ever-evolving tech landscape.</p>\n<p>One day, out of the blue, I received a message from a client associated with IvyBears. They asked if I could assist in resolving several issues within the beta version of their upcoming app.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 700px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/ff6ce3adc5263a97c03a7621fd1c1772/d8b7d/email.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 53.714285714285715%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Message From Client\"\n        title=\"Message From Client\"\n        src=\"/static/ff6ce3adc5263a97c03a7621fd1c1772/03346/email.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/ff6ce3adc5263a97c03a7621fd1c1772/71299/email.jpg 175w,\n/static/ff6ce3adc5263a97c03a7621fd1c1772/1e9fe/email.jpg 350w,\n/static/ff6ce3adc5263a97c03a7621fd1c1772/03346/email.jpg 700w,\n/static/ff6ce3adc5263a97c03a7621fd1c1772/d8b7d/email.jpg 823w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>I defenetely jumped on the project!</p>\n<h3>Overview of the Speech-Based Chat Solution</h3>\n<p>Your current setup involves three main processes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Capture Voice Data:</em> Users' voices are recorded and converted into data.</li>\n<li><em>Transcription:</em> The recorded voice data is sent to OpenAI for transcription into text.</li>\n<li><em>Response Generation:</em> The transcribed text is processed to generate answers to user queries.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The pipeline has been successful on desktop and Android but is facing challenges on iOS devices, where the recording function is returning null values.</p>\n<h3>Common Issues with Voice Recording on iOS</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Permissions: iOS requires explicit user permission to access the microphone. If permissions are not correctly set, the application may not be able to capture audio data.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Audio Session Configuration: In iOS, the audio session must be properly configured for recording. If the audio session is not set up correctly, you may encounter issues.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Microphone Access: Check if the microphone is blocked or not functioning properly. This could occur due to hardware issues or user settings.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>App Lifecycle Management: Ensure that recording logic is correctly intertwined with the app’s lifecycle methods, especially for background execution scenarios.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Error Handling: Implement robust error handling to capture and log any issues that arise during the recording process. This can provide insight into potential causes of null returns.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Detailed Steps to Implement Solutions</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Check Microphone

Producing a continuous flow of words should be easier than this.</p>\n<p>Even now, I’m tempted to spin that previous sentence around in my head over and over, thinking about how I could word it better, or how I could make the point more creatively.</p>\n<p>But you know what? I won’t! Because it states exactly my point, and it’s fine the way it is.</p>\n<p>I feel like I have tons of ideas, bouncing from one thought to another, making intuitive leaps, and it is just a challenge to get it written down. By the time I’m half way through a sentence, I’ve already made several parallel branches in my head of new possibilities I want to go to.</p>\n<p>And by the time I finally get something together, I run it through the ol’ meat grinder over and over again, before scrapping it. What a chore!</p>\n<p>It almost feels like being lost in the woods, constantly backtracking, doubting where I am going.</p>\n<p><strong>There is nothing to writing. All you do is sit down at a typewriter and bleed.</strong> <em>* Ernest Hemmingway *</em></p>\n<p>Thinking, on the other hand, comes naturally. I can get lost in thought for great gulfs of time. But putting those thoughts into concise sentences in writing is always a challenge. For some reason, it’s much easier to do it in real time whilst babbling out words to a person directly with my mouth.</p>\n<p>The only writing I am used to is technical writing, where specificity and clarity is key. Creative writing is much more challenging. And to a logic-worshiping creature such as myself that always sees the world through a lens of rationality, it is fairly easy to visualize what I am trying to accomplish with technical writing. This is not so with creative writing.</p>\n<p>With technical writing, the outline, structure, and details sort of just materialize on their own. I guess this is because is all makes perfectly logic sense up front in the first place, and my job at that point is to communicate it clearly.</p>\n<p>This is very different than communicating creatively.</p>\n<p>With creative writing, I find myself endlessly polishing, rewording, and tweaking what I write, which turns writing into an ordeal for me. I end up with a jumbled mess of ideas scattered around, before thinking up more topics of blog posts I suddenly become passionate about and move onto.</p>\n<p>Seriously, I must have like a dozen unfinished posts now.</p>\n<p>So instead of applying my tried-and-true technical writing approach to creative writing, I’m trying something new. I’m writing in near stream-of-conscious. And I’m not going to go back and doubt every little word in every sentence.</p>\n<p>I’m currently reading the diary of Anne Frank. For a young teenager scribbling away in a diary that she probably thought nobody would ever read, she sure is an excellent writer. And a creative one at that.</p>\n<p>In fact, she writes better than most blog I’ve seen. I’m not sure if it’s because she wasn’t overthinking it, of if she just had a unique combination of maturity, individuality, and intelligence for her age, or if she was a natural-born writer who would’ve blossomed into a successful writing career had she survived into adulthood..</p>\n<p>[…]</p>\n<p>.. ok, back. From a sudden Anne Frank <a href=\"http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=wiki%20spiral\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Wikipedia spiral</a>. Anyways, I wish I could write as easily as Anne Frank.</p>\n<p>Moving along though, I have a great interest in writing. Not my writing, gods no. But in the writing of others. Introspective perception is what it’s all about for me.</p>\n<p>Reading is one of my favorite pastimes, and one thing I really appreciate is all the little nuances authors go through in their writing; the way they spin words and play with them, the sort of imagery they invoke, and the chain reaction of thought they’re able to trigger with the shortest of sentences.</p>\n<p>Underground and 90’s gangster rappers excel in this regard, exceptionally so.</p>\n<p>So let’s see here. I’ve managed to jump topics from writing perfectionism, to technical writing and thinking, to all my unfinished posts, to Anne Frank, to books, and then to rappers.</p>\n<p>And I’m ok with that. Perhaps it’s better this way.</p>\n<p>And hey, that was actually pretty fun that time.</p>"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Docker Compose Error","description":"docker-compose version discrepancies","slug":"/blog/docker-error","date":"2019-12-13","tags":["WordPress","Docker"],"draft":false},"html":"<h2>Problem</h2>\n<p>Recently while updating with <a href=\"https://github.com/Upstatement/skela-wp-theme\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Skela</a> with webpack, I encountered a weird error where I wasn't able to run a simple script:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-code-title\">bin/composer</div>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"shell\"><pre class=\"language-shell\"><code class=\"language-shell\"><span class=\"token shebang important\">#!/bin/bash</span>\r\n<span class=\"token function\">docker-compose</span> <span class=\"token builtin class-name\">exec</span> <span class=\"token parameter variable\">-w</span> /var/www/html/wp-content/themes/skela wordpress <span class=\"token function\">composer</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"<span class=\"token variable\">$@</span>\"</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>When trying to run this script via <code class=\"language-text\">./bin/composer install</code>, I got this error in my terminal:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"shell\"><pre class=\"language-shell\"><code class=\"language-shell\">ERROR: Setting workdir <span class=\"token keyword\">for</span> <span class=\"token builtin class-name\">exec</span> is not supported <span class=\"token keyword\">in</span> API <span class=\"token operator\">&lt;</span> <span class=\"token number\">1.35</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token number\">1.30</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>The error was coming from the <code class=\"language-text\">-w</code> flag in the <code class=\"language-text\">docker-compose exec</code> command in the <code class=\"language-text\">composer</code> script.</p>\n<h2>Solution</h2>\n<p>Turns The fix was to update the version in my <code class=\"language-text\">docker-compose.yml</code> file to from version <code class=\"language-text\">3.5</code> to <code class=\"language-text\">3.6</code>.
